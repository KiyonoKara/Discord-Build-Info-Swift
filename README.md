# Discord Build Info Swift

A playground that gets Discord's latest build information in Swift via Swift Playgrounds.

## Overview
A Swift approach to getting data from Discord App's build information using Playgrounds. This is very concise and is not a library or framework. This implementation serves more useful for showing the implementation of `URLSession` extensions to make synchronous HTTP/HTTPS `GET` requests

## Usage
Main purpose of this repository is to be able to provide an implementation for HTTP/HTTPS requests and its use cases like getting or sending data.
This is mostly for the experience (for now).
